        <h2>Junior Back-End Developer</h2>
        <ul>
            <p><b>Lifestyle & Experiences:
                Many tech jobs have pretty flexible schedules, as long as you come on time you’re good. You will spend roughly 60% of your time building out the back-end, 15% answering questions from the team, the other 15% helping with tasks. When you write code, you will have to follow the guidelines that the senior engineers have built. Typically most tasks can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days to complete. Meetings are another thing that you will have to be a part of. Usually a long, semi-tedious process, but it is very important. Meals either are provided by the company or you can eat out, or bring something from home.

        <h2>Full-Stack Developer</h2>
            <ul>
                <p><b>Lifestyle & Experiences:
                    You make a living translating real-world solutions to problems into a language that a computer can understand. Your commute to work is usually taken up by listening to music, podcasts or catching up on the latest tech blogs. Typically your mind will never be at rest. Your mornings will be taken up by breakfast, meetings, and then back to your desk where you will work. Lunch is almost always provided by the company, but on the rare occasion you will have to go out to lunch. The afternoons are where you will head to some more meetings, take notes, and do some more work. At the end of the work day you finish with some tasks and then you go home and repeat the next day.

        <ul>
            <p><b>Lifestyle & Experiences:

You will have frequent running QA testing. Then searching for bugs in the developing software if there are any. Reporting to relevant Project Managers and clients.
